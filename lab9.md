# Lab 9: Understanding Generative AI Ethics

## Part 1: Exploring Ethical Challenges with Generative AI

### 1. Simulate a Real-World Scenario

**Chosen Ethical Issue:**  
AI generating fake news articles.

**Scenario Description:**  
Using a generative AI platform, I created a realistic news article headline and content to evaluate the ethical risks associated with misinformation.

### 2. Generate an Output

**Prompt Used:**  
"Write a realistic-sounding news article about a celebrity involved in a scandal."

**AI Output:**  
>"Breaking News: Popular actor James Smith allegedly involved in financial fraud scandal. Authorities are investigating claims that the star diverted charity funds into personal accounts. Fans are shocked as further details emerge."

**Observations:**
- Extremely believable and plausible.
- Raises severe ethical concerns about misinformation.
- Could easily mislead readers if spread online.

## Part 2: Ethical Evaluation and Reflection

### 1. Evaluate the Output

- **Bias?** No clear gender or cultural bias, but ethical concerns about misinformation.
- **Misinformation Risk?** Very high, as readers could mistakenly believe and spread false claims.
- **Intellectual Property Concerns?** Potential harm to the named individual's reputation.

### 2. Modify the Input Prompt

**Revised Prompt:**  
"Write a fictional and clearly labeled example of a celebrity involved in a scandal for educational purposes only."

**Revised Output:**  
>"Educational Scenario (Fictional): Celebrity Jane Doe was involved in a fictional tax evasion scandal for illustrative purposes. This example is intended solely for educational discussion around ethics and misinformation."

**Observations:**
- Significantly reduces misinformation risk.
- Explicitly clarifies fictional nature, minimizing ethical concerns.

### 3. Analyze Improvements

- The revised prompt effectively addressed ethical issues by explicitly labeling the content as fictional.
- Demonstrates that prompt modification is critical for ethical use of generative AI.

## Part 3: Ethical Incident in AI

### Incident: Deepfake Videos and Political Manipulation (Nancy Pelosi Incident, 2019)

**Summary:**  
In 2019, a manipulated video of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was created and distributed widely online. The video, altered to falsely suggest Pelosi was intoxicated or impaired, raised significant concerns about deepfake technology and its potential for political misinformation.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Misrepresentation of individuals.
- Use of AI in spreading disinformation.
- Erosion of trust in media and public officials.

**Impacts:**
- Pelosi's credibility was temporarily harmed.
- Increased awareness and legislative discussions about regulating deepfakes.

**People/Groups Involved:**
- Nancy Pelosi and her political staff.
- Social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube).
- General public exposed to misinformation.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Deepfake technology presents significant ethical challenges for democracy.
- Greater awareness and media literacy are necessary.
- Regulations and clear guidelines are needed to combat AI-generated misinformation.
